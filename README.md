# System testing a Java web application
This is the repository for [End-to-end testing Java web applications with an embedded Tomcat](https://georgovassilis.blogspot.com/2016/01/end-to-end-testing-java-web.html) which discusses performing end-to-end tests on
a Java web application. It runs a simple (yet not trivial) Java web application from within the
Maven integration test phase, launches a test browser and interacts with the web application.
